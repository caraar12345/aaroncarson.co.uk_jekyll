  Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m __Aaron__ (_he/him_). Iâ€™m in my third year of studying for a BSc (Hons) degree in [__Cyber Security & Digital Forensics__](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/cyber-security-computer-forensics/) at [__Kingston University London__](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/).

  You can also find me working as an __IT Service Desk Analyst__ at the University during the week, and as an __Activity Co-ordinator__ at [__Monzo__](https://monzo.com) on the weekends.

  _I also have a [__GPG key__](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/93BADDC3FE56CDAB908E9096303C76F0807676E2) which you can use if you want to keep it secret_ ðŸ¤«

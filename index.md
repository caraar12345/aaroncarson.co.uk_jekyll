  Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m __Aaron__ (_he/him_). Iâ€™m in my third year of studying for a BSc (Hons) degree in [__Cyber Security & Digital Forensics__](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/cyber-security-computer-forensics/) at [__Kingston University London__](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/).

  You can also find me working as an __IT Service Desk Analyst__ at the University during the week, and as an __Activity Co-ordinator__ at [__Monzo__](https://monzo.com) on the weekends.

  If youâ€™d ever like to get in touch with me for whatever reason, I have a [**standing invitation**](/contact/standing-invitation) open, so please do email me at [__hello@aaroncarson.co.uk__](mailto:hello@aaroncarson.co.uk) or [__DM me on Twitter__](https://twitter.com/acar321) ðŸ˜„

  _I also have a [__GPG key__](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/93BADDC3FE56CDAB908E9096303C76F0807676E2) which you can use if you want to keep it secret_ ðŸ¤«

  <sup><sub>Please note: I **do not** make outbound calls to customers as part of my role at Monzo. If you receive a call claiming to be from '`Aaron Carson at Monzo`', hang up immediately. ***It is not me.*** My role surrounds the scheduling of our Customer Operations team, as well as related data analysis. I am no longer part of the Customer Operations team, and my role no longer involves contacting customers **in any capacity**. At no time will Monzo (or any bank) unexpectedly call you to request that you move money or to discuss your account. Any and all callbacks will have been organised prior to the time via email or Monzo Chat.</sub></sup>

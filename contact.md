I have a [**standing invitation**](/contact/standing-invitation) in place for you to send me an email - send me anything and I'll more than happily take a look 😄  
Don't expect an instant response however - I have ADHD and I'm also pretty busy.  
So my response time is 'best effort' (but I will respond at some point! If it's been more than a week, please send a followup to yell) 😁

You can also <a href="" onclick="Calendly.initPopupWidget({url: 'https://calendly.com/aaroncarson?hide_landing_page_details=1'});return false;">__schedule in a meeting if you like!__</a> _But please only use this if you have to - emailing me is much preferred_ ♥️

_I also have a [__GPG key__](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/93BADDC3FE56CDAB908E9096303C76F0807676E2)_ 🤫

## What on earth is a standing invitation?

Totally ripped off from [**Matthew Palmer**](https://matthewpalmer.net/standing-invitation/), a standing invitation is just a way of me saying you're all welcome to get in touch for any reason!

Whilst I am open to receiving anything (within reason...), there are some things I am *particularly* interested in.

##### Things I am *particularly* interested in
- Random networking things
- [Self hosted](https://reddit.com/r/SelfHosted) projects
- All things cyber - security or not
- Pictures of your animals (cat pics are always welcome - nay, encouraged)

##### Things that I may take longer to reply to
- Anything that makes me think
- Anything that I need to set up

Again, I have ADHD - if I have to think about it, **and** it's interesting, I will get stuck into it. That's a compliment, I promise you.

<small>If I do take a while to reply, please absolutely send a follow up! There's a good chance I've just forgotten...ðŸ¥´</small>

# My new website! - [![Jekyll CI/CD](https://github.com/caraar12345/aaroncarson.co.uk_jekyll/workflows/Jekyll%20CI/CD/badge.svg)](https://github.com/caraar12345/aaroncarson.co.uk_jekyll/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Jekyll+CI%2FCD%22)

This time it's in Jekyll + Bootstrap rather than WordPress + sobbing.

Who knows? I might actually write some things up for this one.

Helps that I *actually* have a few posts planned too.
